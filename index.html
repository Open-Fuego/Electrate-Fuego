<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. I (S.J. Quigley) use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science. Just follow along with comments like this one, and you will make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other, but explains a little more about the discourse communities that have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual. 

You could do it the easy way like I once did: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/ , or you can do a little more unconcealing... not just unconcealing who you are, but opening these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to really understand our tools and how they work. So let's cut it all open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment... that's how we create! 

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's four discourses of family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. I hope you are excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own Electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want-->
<title>Electrate Fuego</title>

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we will need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block." You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder (directory) as this project (hint: simplify the name). Change the other relevant information, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"... whatever that is?-->

    </div>
    
<!--Bring the fun. Download those beautiful, meaningful "family" photos (only you can define family). Add the photos to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add to the names on the grid below. You can add more if you wish, or subtract... see what happens – you have to be playful to find the purpose of things.-->

<!--Time to write. Flesh it out! Define family, qualify it, explicate it telling us why these people are important, and how they contributed to how you got here and where you are going. Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Gregory Ulmer, who we discussed above, says that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person and how you language yourself. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You will have some opportunities to add video content or other content. You might add an image (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) or perhaps add a photo grid like the one you did for "Family." Experiment. You can't break this thing! Right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

I'll let you explain. -->

Looking to publish this online? Here is what you need to do.

Go back to your forked repository in GitHub. Click upload, and select/drag and drop all of you files... all of them, index.html. style.html, readme, and your images. Click commit. This will replace/add all essential files to make your Electrate Fuego. If you want to delete any of my stinky feet.jpg, be my guest. Great, now your Electrate Fuego is where it needs to be. Now go to settings and click it. This will open up myriad functions. The important one... scroll, scroll down to "GitHub Pages." Here you will change "source" from "none" to "master branch." This will publish your Electrate Fuego online. It's time to spread the fire!
