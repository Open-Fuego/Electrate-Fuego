<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it â€“ for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. Just follow along with the hidden code comments and you'll make a really cool webtext that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going.

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our purposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print."

You could make this webtext the easy way by using Google Site, Adobe Express, Weebly, or Wix, or you can do a little more work to unconceal what's inside the black box - opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will also learn a little bit about coding literacy and computer science...enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language. In this case, United States English. Search engines, browsers, and screen readers use this information to deliver content specific to user needs.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">

<head>
<!--The <head> element contains additional information for search engines and browsers.--> 
<!--The <title> tag controls the name on the browser tab and the next line of code adds a favicon image-->

<!--The <body> element organizes all of the code and content that actually appears on a screen. You can change the background color by opening the style.css document in the body tag properties. Choose a color with enough contrast for your audience. Neutral colors work best for the greatest number of viewers.-->
<body>

<!--Developers refer to this next section as the "hero image." 
Fill in the blank between <h1>"I am..."</h1> and see what happens.
To replace this image, simply find and delete the hero.jpg file in the project folder. Then add a new .jpg hero image to the project folder and name it hero.jpg. Select an image at least 1200px in width to avoid pixilation. If an image is larger than 1200px, you will want to resize it speed up load time. Crop image height to ensure desired fit.--> 

<!--The "hero-image" properties are controlled on the style.css document. We know this because the <div> calls the class="hero-image". You can open the style.css file and find the hero-image class to edit its properties. Alternatively you can edit the file height by cropping the image to fit within the hero-image.-->

<!--Privacy is important factor to consider in online composing. How much do you want others to know about you and what images do you want circulating on the internet? Choose your images and other content carefully and be thoughtful about how your content could impact others. If you are concerned about issues of privacy, you can always use stock images, or get creative in other ways.-->

<!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes...improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you?

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment.
