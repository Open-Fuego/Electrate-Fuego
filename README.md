# Electrate Fuego

Hello, maker! Welcome to the Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad we crossed paths â€“ for this might be an important intersection on your way to becoming. Through this exercise, you'll learn a little bit about code literacy, computer science, and something called "electracy." Just follow the code comments in the HTML file, and you'll make a really cool web document that will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and how they might also contribute to where you're going. By sharing this webtext, we'll meet other people at this intersection, each on their own path to becoming.

In this doc, you'll work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy , 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but we'll separate them here. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps make sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print." 

Before we get going, I want to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the Ulmerian framework we'll follow in this webtext.<p>&nbsp;</p>

##Get started!


1. Scroll to the top of this repository and click the green "**Code**" button. Select "**Download ZIP**" to download project files to your local computer. These are all the project files you'll need to get started working with code.

2. Find this project folder in your downloads and move it to a secure place. You will return to this folder to manage your files and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

3. Download and/or open a code editor. We recommend [Phoenix Code](https://phcode.dev) which runs on a browser or [download](https://phcode.io/#/home) a desktop version.

4. Use the code editor to open your project folder. Open index.html document. Read through the code comments embedded in the index.html document. Here, you'll find all the information you need to work with code! 

5. Once you have modified and added content to your project, you will want to publish your webtext to the internet. GitHub provides a good publishing solution. If you do not already have one, create a GitHub account. [Go to GitHub](https://github.com/)

6. Create a new repository to house your project files. Click  "**uploading an existing file**" and upload your project files to your repository and "**Commit changes**". You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. 

7. Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to **"GitHub Pages"** in the left-hand menu. Change the source setting from **"none"** to **"main" "/root"** and then Click "Save"

8. GitHub will now provide you with a published URL. (This process may take several minutes.)

9. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
